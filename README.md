## Introduction
Climate change poses significant challenges worldwide. This project aims to create a robust forecasting model that helps in understanding climate trends and supports sustainable decision-making.

## Data Collection
Real-time weather data was sourced from [data source/API], ensuring up-to-date information. Historical datasets were also utilized to train and test the model.

## Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, normalizing data, and converting timestamps. Feature engineering was performed to enhance the dataset, focusing on key climatic variables.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to visualize trends, correlations, and anomalies within the data. This phase helped in understanding patterns and informing model selection.

## Modeling
Various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, were tested to determine the best model for forecasting climate variables.

## Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared values. Cross-validation was implemented to ensure model reliability.

## Deployment
The final model is deployed as a web application using [deployment framework, e.g., Flask/Django], allowing users to input parameters and receive climate forecasts in real-time.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of data science principles in climate forecasting. By utilizing real-time data and advanced machine learning techniques, we can gain valuable insights into future climate scenarios.

## Future Work
Future enhancements include integrating more data sources, improving model accuracy, and developing interactive visualizations to better communicate results.
